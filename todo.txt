# TODO:

1) Hello in the console
2) Comment console logs 
3) getUser vs authenticate
4) Display/store deleted user? Created rooms removed, but messages in other rooms?

# Issues:

1) After updating user profile he gets disconnected and disconnect event is emitted, but connect is not, so if he navigates to the room, he is listed as offline.
